#  Sports CLI Manager

A terminal-based sports management application built using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Pipenv. This project allows users to manage teams, players, and player statistics using a clean CLI interface. Designed for Phase 3 to demonstrate ORM, CLI development, and best practices in Python.

---

##  Features

-  Add, delete, and edit **Teams**, **Players**, and **Player Statistics**
-  SQLAlchemy ORM with 3+ related tables
-  Persistent storage using SQLite
-  Interactive CLI menus
-  Organized project structure
-  Virtual environment managed with Pipenv

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python 3.12+
- SQLAlchemy
- Pipenv
- SQLite
- Python standard libraries (`os`, `sys`)

---

## Learning Goals

This project demonstrates the following Phase 3 curriculum concepts:

- Use of **SQLAlchemy ORM** for model relationships
- Creation and modification of a database schema
- Building a **CLI** application using menus and user input
- Use of **lists**, **dictionaries**, and **tuples**
- Applying **coding best practices** (modular structure, readable code)
- Managing a **virtual environment** with Pipenv

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd phase3-project
2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
pipenv install
pipenv shell
3. Create the Database and Tables
bash
Copy
Edit
python -m app.seed
This creates the SQLite database and initializes all required tables.

4. Run the Application #(first run {pipenv install sqlalchemy} secondly run {pipenv shell
#} thirdly run {python main.py}) [ON THE TERMINAL]
